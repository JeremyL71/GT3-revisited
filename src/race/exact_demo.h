// The disc's demo runs (race/demo_replay.h: GT3's own recordings of the licence tests' and arcade time attacks'
// demonstrations) as races on the exact core: the race GT3's replay playback builds from the save (the event under its
// race mode's conductor, the replay header's car record as the race entry, the start as the race's start-up sets it) and the
// recording's pad frames for car 0, as a sim::exact::RaceRecord. The game plays it as it plays a replay
// (ExactFieldOptions::playback); every frame is the one GT3's playback hands the race.
