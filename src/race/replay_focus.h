#pragma once

// The car the replay cameras follow in a field replay, and its battle partner (presentation
// §G3). SDL-free; the race screen feeds it one 60 Hz frame at a time.
//
// Battles: every car has a state (0 none, 1 candidate, 2 battle, 3 after a battle) and a
// partner car. The relation of two cars is 1 within 10 m, else 0 (the original also takes 2 / 3
// from its overtaking pair states, which are not reproduced). A car without a partner searches
// once it has stood 240 frames (4 s): the best-placed car within 20 m related by 1 or more
// becomes its candidate. A candidate becomes a battle when another car within 20 m qualifies
// (or the pair's relation is 2 / 3), turns into state 3 after 121 frames within 10 m, and is
// dropped when the cars are not related or the camera's shot has not settled. A battle (and
// state 3) ends beyond 30 m; a battle turns into state 3 after 240 frames, state 3 ends after
// 241 more. A car the cameras began to follow is held: its state stands still for the hold's
// frames (40 for every car at the start).
//
// Interest: a score per car, recomputed every frame by the target. MANUAL: 1200 for the
// followed car. TOP: 1200 for the leader. AUTO: from the rank's base when the target was set
// (400 / 300 / 200 / 100 / 100 / 100), +10 at random each frame (p 1/60, 1/100, 1/150, 0.0057,
// 0.0047, 1/300 by rank), -1/30 a frame for the followed car and its rival, +150 for a place
// gained, -100 for one lost, clamped 0..1200; plus a bonus by battle state (1: 100, 2: 400,
// 3: 200) times the rank's factor (1.5, 0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.7, 0.65). The cameras re-pick the
// car with the highest score + bonus, never in the first 240 frames after a switch, then every
// 30 frames with p (frames - 240) / 1560, and every frame after 1800 frames; a better car
// becomes the pending pick, which the view mode applies when it can (take_pending).
