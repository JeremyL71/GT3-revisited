// A course's road surface as the vehicle tick's ground query sees it [physics §1.3]: the program's code (the course's
// road block) on the four wheel query records, in EE arithmetic on the course's own floats. Built from our parse of
// the course file (the road block, GTRW): the triangle lookup grid (GTRW +0x48), each segment's vertices (position and the
// two u16 scalars) and triangles (material and flags bytes) and the segment neighbour lists.
