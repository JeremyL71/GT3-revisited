// GT3's pad frame recordings (pad recording): what its replays, its ghosts and the free run's lap
// recordings keep of a car's driving, and how they play it back.
//
// A recorder (pad recording's recorder) turns the frames a car's input device reads (PadFrame, the pad read)
// into a bit stream (bit stream) in a block of memory: +0 the frames recorded, +4 the stream's bytes
// + 8 (both written when the recording is closed), +8 the stream. Each frame is coded against the one before (the steering
// against its linear prediction): the fields that changed, each change as a signed variable-length number, and runs of
// unchanged frames. A recording closes itself when its stream comes within 0x40 bytes of the block's capacity; its playback
// gives every frame but the last (the count check comes first), then empty frames.
//
// A manager (pad recording's manager) binds a recorder to a pool of the game's record memory: in mode 0
// the whole pool (0x20000 bytes less the header), in modes 1 and 2 one of its four stores of 0x8000 bytes (a 0x1B00-byte car
// snapshot, then a block of 0x64F8 bytes).
