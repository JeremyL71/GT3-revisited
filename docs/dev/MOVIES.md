# Movies (FMV playback)

GT3's FMVs are the 51 `stream/*.pss` files (49 on the PAL disc): MPEG-2
program streams with MPEG-2 video and PS-ADPCM audio (format details:
[../formats/pss.md](../formats/pss.md), with the regional differences: NTSC
640×448 at 29.97 / 30 fps, PAL 640×512 at 25 fps).
They are played from the user's disc through the VFS, decoded by our own
code, with no extra dependency.

## Decoder choice

**Decision: a compact MPEG-2 video decoder of our own (`src/video/`, ~800
lines plus tables).**

Requirements were: all targets (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android), nothing for
the user to install, licence compatible with an open-source project, and
real-time playback on phones.

| Option | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Own decoder (chosen) | MP@ML with only what the disc uses is small: VLC tables, IDCT, dequantisation, half-pel MC, I/P/B reordering. No build or licence questions, identical on every platform, and fast enough (below). |
| FFmpeg (libavcodec) via FetchContent | LGPL/GPL, autotools build that does not fit CMake FetchContent; cross-compiling for Android/Windows is a project of its own. Far too heavy for 51 files. |
| libmpeg2 | GPL-2 (would force the whole project to GPL), unmaintained since 2008, needs autotools. |
| pl_mpeg (single header, MIT) | Licence and build would be fine, but it decodes MPEG-1 only. |
| Platform decoders (MediaCodec, VideoToolbox, Media Foundation) | MPEG-2 support is optional/absent on many devices (Android drops it), four code paths, and PS2-specific audio still needs our code. |

What is supported (and what throws `FormatError` instead): MPEG-2 Main
Profile 4:2:0 frame pictures, I/P/B, frame motion vectors with half-pel
interpolation, frame and field DCT, linear/non-linear quantiser scale, both
intra VLC tables, zigzag and alternate scan, loaded or default quantiser
matrices (sequence header and quant matrix extension), concealment vectors
(parsed), open/closed GOPs and broken links, PTS tracking and display
reordering. Not supported: MPEG-1 streams, field pictures, field/dual-prime
motion compensation, 4:2:2/4:4:4, scalability. None of these occur on the
disc (surveyed: every picture coding extension of all 51 files).

## Code map

### Data flow

```
Volume::read_range ──► PssDemuxer ──► E0 payload + PTS ──► Mpeg2Decoder ──► Frame queue (≤ 6) ──► IYUV texture
   (64 KB reads)              └──► BD payload ──► byte FIFO ──► AdsStream ──► SDL_AudioStream (≈0.25 s queued)
```

* **Streaming:** nothing is loaded whole. The demuxer reads 64 KB chunks;
  video packets are queued only until the decoder consumes them; the audio
  FIFO is trimmed as `AdsStream` reads forward. `open_movie` uses
  `Vfs::open_stream`, so movies replaced or added by mods stream too.
* **Decoder input:** `push()` takes ES bytes in any chunking. The decoder
  splits at start codes and decodes each slice as soon as the next start
  code arrives, so it never buffers a whole picture.
* **Timestamps:** a PES PTS is attached to the first picture start code
  that begins in that packet; pictures without one get previous + frame
  period. Frames come out in display order with their PTS.

### Playback and A/V sync (`MoviePlayer`)

A worker thread keeps ≈0.25 s of PCM queued in an SDL audio stream the
player owns (opened on the default device, independent of `AudioEngine`;
gain = music volume) and up to 6 decoded frames ahead. Audio has priority
so it never underruns while video decodes.

On the main thread `update()` advances the clock by wall time and, while
audio plays, steers it toward `audio start offset + (samples put − samples
still queued) / rate` (`audio_clock_correction`: over about 2 s within 30 ms,
over a quarter second further off, a jump past 100 ms after a stall — the raw
audio position moves in device-buffer steps of 10–20 ms, so a stronger pull
would make the clock's steps uneven);
silent movies (48 of 51) and the tail after the audio ends use the wall
clock. The newest frame whose PTS is due is uploaded with
`SDL_UpdateYUVTexture` (IYUV, BT.601 limited range, SDL's default for YUV
textures); late frames are dropped. Pause stops the audio device and freezes
the clock. `start_seconds` decodes and discards up to a start time (used for
screenshots; there is no index for real seeking).

Frames are shown by their timestamps whatever the movie's rate and the
display's: on a 60 Hz display a 25 fps PAL movie's 50 fields a second take
1 or 2 refreshes each (6 refreshes per 5 fields), on 120 Hz 2 or 3 (12 per
5); NTSC's 60 fields a second take one refresh each on 60 Hz and two on
120 Hz (at 29.97 fps one field in 1,000 takes an extra one). A frame and its
second field are both due up to 2 ms early (`kEarly`); when only frames were,
29.97 fps at 60 Hz showed no second fields for about 2 s in every 16.7 s, while
the refreshes fell just before the frames' times. `set_time_source()` steps
the clock like a display's refreshes in tests (`video_player_cadence_pal_ntsc`,
and `video_player_audio_steering` against a simulated audio position).
A full-screen movie logs one line when it ends or is skipped, e.g.
`Movie stream/opening.pss: 640x512 25.00 fps (2 fields/frame), 219.12 s:
5472 frames shown, 7 dropped, audio clock, A/V within 16 ms` (dropped: frames
passed over after a late refresh; a stall past 100 ms adds "1 jump back in
sync after a stall").

**Picture shape** (`movie_display_aspect`, `fit_4_3`): the PS2 shows a movie
in its 640-pixel-wide display frame, which fills the 4:3 TV picture: 448
lines on NTSC and 512 on PAL, told apart by the frame rate (PAL movies run at
25 fps). Both 640×448 and 640×512 movies therefore show at 4:3; smaller
pictures keep that pixel shape (`menu_bg2`'s 320×112 strip). Menu pages draw
their movies into the page's own movie box instead.

### Field-split movies

48 of the 51 movies (46 of PAL's 49) are *field-split*: each 640×448 MPEG
frame is two 640×224 pictures stacked — the first field on top, the second
field (1/60 s later) below. PAL's 640×512 frames hold two 640×256 fields
1/50 s apart, in the same order and line positions (checked on the disc: the
motion from the top half to the bottom half continues into the next frame's
top half, and the top half woven onto the even lines is the smooth picture).
The PS2 sends them to the TV as the two interlaced fields; FFmpeg
shows the stacked halves as-is. Nothing in the stream marks this, so
`FieldLayoutDetector` (`src/video/field_layout.*`) decides per movie from the
first 16 non-flat frames: the luma rows on either side of the middle seam
are discontinuous in field-split frames (ratio of seam difference to
neighbouring row differences > 3). Survey: the 48 field-split movies have
≥ 94% of frames above the threshold, the 3 progressive ones (`ending_long_full`,
`ending_short_full`, `menu_bg2`) ≤ 1.6% (PAL: ≥ 97% and ≤ 0.4%). The player
then draws the top half for the first half of each frame period and the bottom
half for the second ("bob", 60 pictures/s, 50 on PAL, each field stretched to
the full height).
`MoviePlayer::picture_rects()`/`draw()` place each field with its half-line
offset (first field on even frame lines, second on odd: source rows mapped
with +1/4 resp. −1/4 field line, drawn over frame rows [0, H−1) resp.
[1, H)), so static detail does not bob up and down; the rectangles stay
inside each field's half of the texture, so the halves never bleed into
each other. CORE.GT3's own movie table carries the same distinction as a
per-movie flag (pss.md).

## Game-flow API

| Use | API |
|---|---|
| Full-screen movie, then continue | `play_movie(app, "stream/opening.pss", on_done, options)` / `make_movie_screen(...)` in `src/app/screen_movies.h`. Pops itself at the end, on skip (Cross/Start/Circle unless `skippable = false`) or if the file cannot be opened, then calls `on_done(app)`. `loop = true` for attract loops. |
| Boot | screen id `boot` (`make_boot_screen()`): opening movie, then the `gt3menu` screen |
| Movie inside a menu page | `video::MoviePlayer`: `start_loop([vfs]{ return video::open_movie(*vfs, "stream/menu_bg2.pss"); })`, `update(renderer)` every frame, `draw(renderer, rect)` (handles field-split movies) |
| Course preview stills | `video::CoursePreviews`: `load(vfs)`, `image("akasaka")` → `RgbaImage` (640×448 RGBA, 640×512 on PAL, cached) |

`GT3R_SKIP_MOVIES=1` makes game-flow movies end immediately (development).

`gt3tool video-frames` exports the raw stacked frames.

## Verification

### Video vs FFmpeg (all 51 files)

`gt3tool video-psnr` decodes a movie and compares it frame by frame with raw
`yuv420p` from FFmpeg 8 (Homebrew) piped in:

```bash
ffmpeg -v error [-idct int] -i x.pss -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p - | gt3tool video-psnr <iso> stream/x.pss - q
```

| Reference | Frames | Frame count match | PSNR min | PSNR mean | Max sample diff | Identical frames |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FFmpeg `-idct int` (same IDCT family) | 39,307 | 51/51 | 77.6 dB | 86.7 dB | 2 | 364 |
| FFmpeg default (`simple` IDCT) | 39,307 | 51/51 | 58.4 dB | 63.0 dB | 7 | 294 |

Differences come only from IDCT rounding (MPEG-2 allows any IEEE 1180
compliant IDCT, and the error accumulates through P/B chains until the next
I picture). Against FFmpeg's `int` IDCT (libjpeg's integer LLM, the same
algorithm with different special-case arithmetic) PSNR is above 77 dB with
at most ±2 per sample, which shows everything else — VLC parsing,
dequantisation, mismatch control, motion compensation, rounding of
bidirectional prediction, reordering — matches exactly. Full per-file results
come from `gt3tool video-psnr` against FFmpeg's decode of every file.

### Playback timing in the app

The opening of each release, played in a windowed app on an M-series Mac with
every refresh traced (picture, field, clock, audio position): fields skipped
without a late refresh before them, and how many refreshes each field stayed
on screen, before and after the two fixes above (the gentler audio steering,
the second field's early rule).

| Opening, display | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| NTSC-U, 60 Hz | 282 skipped, 316 twice; no second fields for 19 s in all | 29 skipped, 34 twice (a few at each 16.7 s drift past a field's time) |
| NTSC-U, 120 Hz | 6 skipped; 1,553 fields 1 refresh, 1,529 3 (of 13,000) | none skipped; 258 and 260 (12,547 two) |
| PAL, 60 Hz | 3 skipped | 1 skipped; 8,550 one, 2,130 two (6 refreshes per 5 fields) |
| PAL, 120 Hz | 1 skipped | none; 6,281 two, 4,163 three (12 per 5) |

The clock kept to the wall clock within 10 ms over the whole movie, and to the
audio position within 6 ms on average (16–43 ms at worst, at the start).

### Audio

The concatenated `BD` payloads (`gt3tool video-ads`) are recognised by FFmpeg
as an `.ads` file (`adpcm_psx`, 44100 Hz, stereo), with the same sample count
as our decoding (`gt3tool video-wav`) for all 3 movies with audio. The
existing PS-ADPCM decoder rounds `(x + 32) >> 6` where FFmpeg truncates, so
samples differ by about ±24 on average, plus a few hundred samples (of 20 M)
around full-scale clipping in `opening.pss`/`ending_long_full.pss` where the
two decoders saturate history differently (`src/formats/ps_adpcm.*`, not
owned by this workstream).

### Tests

`tests/test_video.cpp` (filter `video`): VLC table integrity, IEEE 1180-style
IDCT accuracy against the double-precision reference, a hand-encoded
synthetic MPEG-2 stream (I/P/B, skipped macroblocks, reordering, PTS, a
half-pel vector), a
synthetic program stream for the demuxer (packs, padding, resync, private
stream 1 sub-header), a synthetic movie with audio, a synthetic `ipua`
archive, the field-split detector on synthetic frames, and disc tests (skipped
without `GT3R_DISC`; any region's disc, with its own sizes and rates):
`menu_bg2.pss` fully (360 frames, PAL 300), `opening.pss` start with audio
and its timestamps, the first frames of every movie and their picture shape,
and the course preview stills (none on the NTSC-J disc). Playback timing:
`MoviePlayer` stepped like 60 and 120 Hz displays through synthetic 25, 30
and 29.97 fps field-split movies, checking every refresh's picture and field
against the timestamps, and the audio steering against a position that moves
in device buffers. 15 tests: 11 run without the disc, 4 skip. The IDCT
meets every IEEE 1180 limit (peak error 1, worst per-pixel MSE 0.017 vs 0.06,
overall MSE ≤ 0.014 vs 0.02, means ≤ 0.0035 / 0.00026 vs 0.015 / 0.0015).

The Android
build (`libmain.so`) includes the movie code.

## Performance

Single-threaded decode, RelWithDebInfo (`-O2`), Apple Silicon Mac,
`gt3tool video-survey` (demux + decode + frame copy, all 51 files, audio
included): **39,307 frames (1,311 s of video) in 29.8 s = 1,320 fps, 44×
real time**, i.e. about 0.75 ms per 640×448 frame (worst single frame ≈ 4 ms).

In the app (scratch harness running `MoviePlayer` at a 60 Hz render loop
for 12 s): `opening.pss` 0 dropped frames, decode avg 1.0–1.4 ms, presented
frame within 3–9 ms of the audio clock; `akasaka_full.pss` (wall clock)
0 dropped.

Mobile: a mid-range ARM64 phone core is roughly 3–5× slower than an M-series
core on scalar integer code, i.e. ≈4–5 ms per frame against a 33 ms budget,
on a worker thread. The IYUV upload is 430 KB per frame (13 MB/s). Further
headroom if ever needed: NEON for MC/IDCT, skipping the IDCT for DC-only
blocks, or decoding into the texture directly.

## Next steps

* Seeking (byte-ratio seek to a pack, resync on the next I picture and the
  audio interleave block whose PTS matches).
