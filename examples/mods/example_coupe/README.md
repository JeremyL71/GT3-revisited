# Example Coupe: a complete mod car

This folder is a working mod that adds one car, the **GT3R Concept Coupe**: a
front-engined, rear-drive 2+2 with a 3.0-liter V6, a six-speed manual and
22-inch wheels. It is meant to be copied. Every file is small and commented, so you
can see how each part of a car mod works and then replace it with your own.

It shows:

- a car defined as data (`cars/gt3r_concept_coupe_24.ini`): dimensions, weight,
  engine curve, gearing, tires, paints, dealer and arcade settings, with a comment
  on every value
- a body of its own (`models/concept_coupe.glb`, binary glTF) with materials
  named for the game's loader, and wheels drawn by the engine from the tire sizes
- a new maker with its own dealer (`makers/gt3r.ini`)
- dealer pictures rendered with the game itself (`images/`)
- the scripts that turned a downloaded model into the game-ready body
  (`source/`)
- performance fitted to real-world targets with `gt3tool modcar`

The format is described in [docs/MODDING.md](../../../docs/MODDING.md) ("Adding cars").

## Install

The example is not installed with the game; add it yourself when you want to
try modding. Zip the `example_coupe` folder and choose **Install from .zip** on the
Mods screen, or copy the whole folder into the `mods` folder of your user data folder
(the Mods screen shows where it is; **Open folder** opens it):

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\GT3Revisited\GT3Revisited\mods\`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/GT3Revisited/GT3Revisited/mods/`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/GT3Revisited/GT3Revisited/mods/`
- Android: in the Files app, under **GT3 Revisited** > `mods`

A new mod is enabled (the Mods screen reads the folder again when you come back to
the game; Cross turns a mod off and on). Select **Example Coupe** there: the screen
lists the car, or the reason it failed to load.

## Try it

- **Time trial** or **Quick race**: pick the GT3R Concept Coupe from the car list.
- **GT Mode**: it is for sale at the GT3R dealer, on the Europe > Germany page of
  the car dealers, for 52,000 credits. The color picker offers the six `[paints]`.
- **Arcade**: it joins the class its power-to-weight ranks it in, at the end of the
  car list.
- **Car viewer** (`gt3r --screen cars`): the entry `mod:gt3r_concept_coupe_24`.

## Make it yours

1. Copy the folder and rename it (the folder name is the mod's id).
2. Give the car a new `label` (and rename the `.ini` to match). Labels must be
   unique: a mod car can never replace a disc car, and two mods with the same label
   replace each other.
3. Change the numbers. Anything you delete is borrowed from the `donor`.
4. Replace the body, or delete the `[model]` section to use the donor's shell,
   stretched to your `[body]` dimensions.
5. Check it with `gt3tool modcar` (below), then look at it in the car viewer and on
   track.

## The body

The model is Khronos' CarConcept sample (see Credits), prepared with the scripts in
`source/`:

| Step | Script |
|---|---|
| Delete the wheels, tires, brakes, axles, engine, under-hood panels, pedals, small interior parts, the wiper blades and the steering-wheel emblem; decimate (213,347 to 40,063 triangles); join into one mesh; put the origin at the wheelbase midpoint on the ground; rename the materials | `prepare.py` (Blender, `blender -b --factory-startup --python prepare.py -- CarConcept.glb stage1.glb`) |
| Set each material's color, drop the PBR extensions and textures the game doesn't use, draw a plain "GT3R" license plate, repack the GLB (11.8 MB to 1.3 MB) | `finish.py` (Python 3, no dependencies) |
| Measure what goes into `[body]` | `measure_glb.py` |

The loader's conventions (docs/MODDING.md "Car models"): meters, +Y up, the car
facing +Z, the origin at the wheelbase midpoint on the ground. Materials are
recognized by name:

| Material | Role |
|---|---|
| `body_paint` | takes the chosen `[paints]` color, reflective |
| `window_glass` | tinted, alpha blended (alpha 0.62), reflective |
| `headlamp` | self-lit |
| `taillamp` | lights up under braking |
| `trim_gloss_black`, `trim_black`, `mirror_chrome`, `chassis_dark`, `interior_*`, `indicator_amber`, `plate`... | lit with their own base color; the roof, sills and hood vent stay black whatever the paint |

Avoid the role words in other names: a material called `underbody` would be painted.

The game uses base color factors as they are (no linear-to-sRGB conversion), so
`finish.py` sets them to the colors you want to see, not to PBR values. Wheels and
tires come from the engine: their size from `[tires]`, their positions from the
wheelbase and tracks, and the rim from `[model] wheel` (a disc rim). That is why
the body has none.

### Measuring the model

`measure_glb.py models/concept_coupe.glb` prints the body's extent. The modeled
wheels were measured in `prepare.py` before they were deleted: wheelbase 2,799 mm,
tracks 1,952 / 1,964 mm, tires 768 mm across on 22-inch rims. The `[tires]` sizes
were chosen to match that diameter, so the engine's wheels fill the arches.

## Tuning

```bash
gt3tool modcar game.iso examples/mods/example_coupe
```

loads the car, prints its specs and test-drives it on the game's own physics, on
the machine tests' course, next to the `[reference]` targets (magazine figures for
cars of its class: ~300 PS, 1,420 kg, rear drive, summer tires). Results:

| Test | Game | Target |
|---|---|---|
| 0-60 mph (1 ft rollout) | 5.08 s | 5.1 s |
| Quarter mile (1 ft rollout) | 13.48 s @ 107 mph | 13.5 s |
| Top speed (GT3's top-speed test) | 270 km/h | 270 km/h |
| 60-0 mph | 88 ft | |

How the values were chosen: with the first guesses (`output_pct` 112, `grip_pct` 102)
the car held 1.09 g on a 300 ft skidpad, far more than a road car, because the
donor's street tires on a car this wide grip like semi-slicks. `grip_pct = 88`
brought it to 0.94 g, but less grip also slowed the launch, so `output_pct` went up
to 118 (the R34 GT-R uses the same value). That put 0-60 and the quarter mile on
target, but the car topped out at 263 km/h, so the drag came down a little: `cd`
0.31 to 0.29 and the frontal area 2.10 to 2.06 m². The skidpad figures were measured
with an earlier version of the tool, which no longer drives a skidpad. Fit the trap
speed and top speed with power and drag first, then 0-60 with `output_pct`, and
repeat once.

## Pictures

The dealer picture is a car viewer screenshot on the viewer's own dark backdrop,
cropped and scaled by `source/pictures.py` (Python 3 with Pillow):

```bash
GT3R_VIEWER="find=mod:gt3r_concept_coupe_24,clean=1,yaw=2.35,pitch=0.14,zoom=0.75" gt3r game.iso --screen cars --shot shot.png
python3 source/pictures.py shot.png images/concept_coupe.png images/concept_coupe_thumb.png
```

Add `key=1` to `GT3R_VIEWER` for a flat magenta background you can key out instead.
